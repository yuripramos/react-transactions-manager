## :cloud: Installation

Makefiles aren't Windows friendly, if you have minGW64 and whole environment to run the makefile(Unix/macOS) do this:

```sh
make installation
make start
access http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

If you **don't** have makefile enviroment ready, do this instead :

```sh

npm install or yarn install
npm run start
access http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

**Requires node >= 8.9.3**

## Why Redux-zero as a state manager?

[Redux-zero](https://github.com/redux-zero/redux-zero) is a lightweight state container based on Redux.
I would like to share 3 arguments to choose redux-zero over redux.

1. Is lighter(less than 1kb) than redux and in projects that are not necessarily high usage of reducers, it helps to focus on what is important.
2. I participated in the conception of this lib, made mostly by an ex-coworker.
3. I'm currently focusing my career in leadership and share knowledge that I've learned across these years, so would be
   an honor gives a presentation about this amazing library.

## Tests?

As required in the challenge the focus was in the UI itself and the 3 Features, to make things easier and to avoid unnecessary work wasn't made any kind of unit tests in this project, just a few snapshots tests, but after that, I decided to remove the jest environment.

**Basically, the manual tests made in this project was about the user filling each input if the user didn't fill all fields the transaction will not be created**


## :pound: AvailableBalance Feature 

1. The money will just counted when you choose the type of transaction `debit` if you choose `credit` instead  the money will not be withdrawn.

2. The application allows negative amount of money.
