## :cloud: Installation

Makefiles aren't Windows friendly, if you have minGW64 and whole environment to run the makefile(Unix/macOS) do this:

```sh
make installation
make start
access http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

If you **don't** have makefile enviroment ready, do this instead :

```sh

npm install or yarn install
npm run start
access http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

**Requires node >= 8.9.3**

**Release 0.2** - Unit and e2e tests

**Release 0.3** - Improvements in mobile devices screens

**Release 0.4** - Improvements in UX and transistions
